Building from source

  * Checking out the source
  
  []
  
  The source is currently checked into the sandbox area of the OpenEJB project's subversion repository. To checkout the source,
  run this command with your subversion client.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openejb/trunk/sandbox/openejb-eclipse-plugin openejb-eclipse-plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  * Building the source
  
  []
  
  To build the plugin you will need Maven (the build has been tested with Maven 2.0.7). To run the build, issue this command
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn -Dassemble clean install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You should be aware that this will download any dependencies, including a copy of Eclipse. This will take a while for your first build.
  
  * Importing the plugin code into an Eclipse workspace
  
  []
  
  You can generate the Eclipse projects for the plugins by running the following command
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  You can add the M2_REPO classpath variable to your Eclipse workspace by running the following command
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
