<h1>Deploying a project</h1>
<p>In order to deploy your project to an OpenEJB server in Eclipse, your project must be a Java EE project, with the EJB facet enabled. If your project doesn't have the Faceted nature, you can use the OpenEJB plugin to add it. Simply select OpenEJB->Add Faceted Nature from the menu bar.</p>
